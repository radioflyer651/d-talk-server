## Core Components

### 1. Chat Rooms, Agents & Jobs

- **ChatRoom**: The central hub for conversations, managing messages, agents, plugins, jobs, and documents. Each chat room maintains its own state, message history, and event system.
- **Agent**: Represents an AI or human participant, configurable with identity, instructions, and plugins. Agents interact with users and other agents, leveraging language models for intelligent responses.
- **Chat Job**: Defines a specific task or conversational objective within a chat room. Each job can have its own plugins, system messages, and context, allowing for multi-step workflows or specialized agent behaviors. Chat jobs help structure conversations, inject important system information, and manage job-specific documents. They participate in the chat lifecycle as `IChatLifetimeContributor`, enabling them to add context, manage state, and influence the flow of conversation.

### 2. Plugins & Lifetime Contributors

- **Plugin System**: Plugins extend chat functionality, providing tools, context, and custom logic. Examples include memory modules, inner voice monologues, and document editing tools.
- **IChatLifetimeContributor Interface**: The backbone of extensibility. Contributors implement lifecycle hooks to interact with chat messages, modify context, inject tools, and handle replies. This enables:
	- Pre-processing and post-processing of messages
	- Dynamic tool availability
	- Context injection (e.g., memory, instructions)
	- Custom reply handling and cleanup

#### Chat Lifetime Contributor Lifecycle

Contributors can participate at various stages:

- **Initialization**: Setup resources or state before chat begins
- **Pre-Chat**: Inspect or modify initial messages
- **Modify Call Messages**: Adjust message history before LLM invocation
- **Add Pre-Chat Messages**: Inject system/context messages
- **Inspect Chat Call Messages**: Analyze or augment messages before reply
- **Handle Reply**: Process LLM replies, insert additional messages
- **Chat Complete**: Finalize or clean up after chat session
- **Tool Integration**: Provide tools callable by the LLM during chat

This lifecycle enables deep customization and integration of new features without changing core logic.

### 3. Document Management

- **TextDocument**: Editable documents with line-level operations, comments, and metadata. Integrated into chat for collaborative editing.
- **Document Tools**: Plugins provide tools for editing, commenting, and managing documents, accessible via chat commands or agent actions.

### 4. Database & Persistence

- **MongoDB Integration**: Stores chat history, user data, agent configurations, documents, and plugin states for reliability and scalability.

### 5. Socket & API Services

- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket services enable live chat, message streaming, and event notifications.
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful interfaces for chat management, user authentication, and data access.
